 Tier 1: Polish What’s Already Working
<!-- Fix	What’s Wrong	What to Do
🧠 Improve AI replies	Repeats journal text or feels too dry	Tweak prompt to FLAN-5 like:
"Give a kind, short, empathetic message to someone who wrote this journal: ..." -->
📊 Fix mood dashboard (0 chart)	Pie chart empty or chart = 0	In mood_dashboard.py, add: done
if mood_counts.empty: st.info("No mood data yet!") before plotting
📅 Mood trend bar not showing?	May be grouping incorrectly	Ensure Timestamp column is parsed correctly with:
df["Timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Timestamp"], errors='coerce')
📝 Detect multi-emotions	Only shows POSITIVE / NEGATIVE	Replace sentiment pipeline with multi-emotion model (see below) doen

🔹 Tier 2: Add Smart, Cool Stuff
Feature	Description
💬 Better emotion model	Use j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base or bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion to get labels like joy, sadness, anger done
🌈 Mood-aware journaling prompts	If mood is sad → generate comforting writing prompt ????
📈 Mood over time (line chart)	Show how mood changes across days/weeks done 
📌 Word cloud or keyword summary	NLP summary of the past week’s most-used words
🧘 If mood = sad → recommend music / TED talk	Auto-embed YouTube video or Spotify link if needed

🧠 Mood forecasting	Use basic ML (e.g., logistic regression) to predict tomorrow’s mood
🧵 Conversation bot	Let user talk to a GPT-style chatbot with memory of past feelings
