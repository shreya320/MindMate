2025-06-27 00:16:33,"my placements are looming near the corner, and its scary, i feel like im not doing enough and its worring me and scaring me ",fear,"Oh honey, I hear you.  Placement season is *intense*, and it's completely understandable to feel scared and worried. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, and that's a heavy burden to carry.  Remember that feeling like you're not doing enough is incredibly common –  most people feel that way at some point!  You've already gotten this far, which is a massive accomplishment in itself. Try to focus on what you *have* done, and celebrate those successes.  

Maybe take a little time to break down what's specifically worrying you.  Is it a particular aspect of your application, a fear of not getting the right placement, or something else entirely?  Once you identify the source of your fear, it might be easier to tackle it head-on, perhaps by making a small, manageable plan to address it.

And most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing your best, and that's all anyone can ask.  If you need to take a break from applications for a while to recharge, that’s okay too.  You deserve some self-compassion right now. Let me know if you want to brainstorm some coping mechanisms or just want to chat it through – I'm here for you."
2025-06-27 01:03:52,"i just want to end it all now, i feel hopeless",sadness,"Oh, sweetheart, reading that breaks my heart.  It sounds like you're in so much pain right now, and feeling utterly hopeless is incredibly overwhelming. Please know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there is support available.  Those feelings are real and valid, and it takes incredible strength to even write them down.

Ending it all might feel like the only option right now, but I truly believe there's still hope for things to get better. Even if it feels impossible to see it right now, there are people who care deeply about you and want to help you through this.

Would you like me to help you find some resources?  There are crisis hotlines, online support groups, and mental health professionals who are trained to help people work through these feelings.  Even just talking to someone might make a difference.  

Please, please don't hesitate to reach out.  You deserve to feel better, and you don't have to carry this burden alone.  Taking that first step to reach out is a huge act of bravery.  Let's take that step together.  What small thing, even something tiny, could we focus on right now to help you feel a little bit better?"
